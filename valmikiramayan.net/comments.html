the
people of modern generation especially to people in other country where
Indians live, where they want to uphold our culture.  I suggest a few
things: 1. It will be nice if u add pic to each chapter 2.  If u can 
bring
other site like Mahabharat and Bhaghawat Gita.

It is really great.

If there is a picture of Valmiki which can be uploaded onto
this site it will be great.

Good Job!

Congratulations on this magnificent effort. I had the
original sanskrit at home in India and had even browsed
the original Sanskrit on www.hscc.net. But you
have provided the translation with the original text
which is really helpful for people like me.

Thanks a million for this great resource.

I am grateful to learn something of this great epic poem.

I am interested in Rudyard Kipling's &quot;Just So&quot; stories, and curious 
about
the literary genre in which they are written.  I suspect it is a form 
of
etioligical narrative peculiar to South East Asia, and probably India - 
How
the Camel got his Hump, How the Leopard got his Spots etc. - and would 
be
grateful if anyone can throw light on the characteristics and 
provenance of
this literary genre.  I would be most grateful.  My e-mail no is above.
